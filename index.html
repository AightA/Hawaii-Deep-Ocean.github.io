          Researchers trust that 80 percent of the volcanic ejections on Earth occur in the sea. A large portion of these volcanoes are a large number of feet profound, and hard to discover. In any case, in May of 2009, researchers caught the most profound sea
          ejection at any point found.</h3>

          <h4> Kilauea is one of the world's most dynamic volcanoes. It is a shield-type well of lava that makes up the southeastern side of the Big Island of Hawaii. The well of lava rises 4,190 feet (1,227 meters) above ocean level and is around 14
            percent of the land territory of the Big Island. The summit caldera contains a magma lake known as Halema`uma`u that is said to be the home of the Hawaiian spring of gushing lava goddess, Pele.
